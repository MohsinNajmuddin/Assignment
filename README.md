Following features are implemented

1. Integrated API and showing the record.
2. Showing the record category vise as per the mock
3. User will be able to apply the filters of sub-categories
4. Charts will be shown with each row.

P.S: Currently the charts data is hardcoded. I ran out of time to implment it.
